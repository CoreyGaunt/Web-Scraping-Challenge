# Web-Scraping-Challenge

In this project, I had to write a jupyter notebook and python files to scrape various websites and compile information on Mars.

Once the information was scraped, we had to push it to a mongodb for storage, and then create an index.html file to leverage the data on the mongodb

lastly, we had to build a scrape function that could be called by a click of a button to repopulate the information
